<h1> <strong>Title Project:</strong> Doggy hub </h1>
<h2> Overview Idea </h2>
<p> As a new dog mom, I never used to think much about the personalities or traits of dogs. Where I come from, most dogs are mixed, and their personalities remain unknown. However, I recently adopted a Beagle mix Labrador, and I'm always eager to learn more about them. That's why the primary feature of this website is a search engine designed to help you explore different dog breeds and understand their characteristics. This knowledge can assist you in making a well-informed decision based on your needs and lifestyle when bringing home a new pup. I've also included the fun facts feature to find daily facts about dogs, particularly appealing to dog lovers, as it introduces surprising aspects of dogs that you might not be aware of.
Lastly, I've added a random photo gallery to cheer you up when you need a pup smile. </p>

<h2>Explain a technical hurdle (something you struggled with) </h2>
<p>The most challenging aspect was finding the right API that had all the features that I wanted for my search engine.
I found a few APIs returning just images, and others, with only basic data information but no images. Moreover, it was really hard integrating two APIs from different websites and to make 
them return the same breed information. Finally, it was hard to create a function that returns the same breed info without using the id parameter or the name parameter. </p>

<h2> Learning Process </h2>
<p>I learned that I ALWAYS need to test the API before getting halfway through my idea. I also learned  how to navigate various API documentations and discover the most suitable API based on my goals. 
Aditionally, connecting two APIs from different sources was the highlight of my learning journey within this project; I wasn't expecting to make it work. 
Lastly, when I saw my app functionality working without any bugs and finally being able to incorporate the CSS, that was the moment that I felt truly content. </p>

Additionally, connecting two APIs from different sources stood out as the highlight of my learning journey within this project; I hadn't anticipated successfully achieving it.

<h2> Feature app </h2>
<p> I would like to incorporate an "Upload your dog photo" section, wenabling users to submit images of their pups. These images would be added to a new gallery section. Additionally, I intend to provide the capability of introducing new breeds, complete with relevant informationâ€”examples being breeds like the Beagle mix Labrador. I also would like implementing a  "Favorite" feature. This feature would allow users to save breeds they're interested in. Lastly, my intention is to introduce a breed comparison tool. This tool would enable users to compare different breeds based on their specific needs. For example, they could compare breeds known for being excellent with kids. </p>
